Relationship among land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with topographic elements in Central America.

A Land Surface Temperature 5 years time series analysis between 2019-2023 combined with a separate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) 5 years time series analysis during the same period and a DEM model with topographic slope elements in three different countries in Central America such as Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panama aims to demonstrate the relationship among them as indicators of warmth rising off Earth’s landscapes influences (and is influenced by) our world’s weather and climate patterns. 
The study is applied to Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panama due to their different landforms and infrastructure despite their geographical proximity. The current study used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor due to its optimal temporal coverage and its global coverage.
This study's findings can be used to ensure sustainable urban development and minimize urban heat island effects by providing effective guidelines for urban planners, policymakers, and respective authorities in the Central America region. The current thermal remote sensing findings can be used to model energy fluxes and surface processes in the study area. It is important to note that how this study was carried out allows for its applicability to other areas of the world.

Scientists want to monitor how increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases affect land surface temperature, and how rising land surface temperatures affect glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and the vegetation in Earth’s ecosystems.
